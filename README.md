# KCL final project
This repo contains the pdf of the paper I wrote as 
part of my MSc in Theoretical Physics at King's Colledge London,
as well as the sorce .tex file used to generate it (src/main.tex).
The paper is titled 'Quantum fields in de Sitter space' and it
explores the behaviour of quantum field theory in a universe with
a positive cosmological constant. There is evidence to suggest that
the universe we live in is asymptotically de Sitter.
